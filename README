HelloWorld Scala Servlet

This is a very simple servlet meant to demonstrate embedding jetty in scala
using sbt 0.10 in order to create a runnable servlet.  The documentation around
using jetty with sbt 0.10 was rather skimpy so this took much longer than it
should have.

To run this program, in sbt run

  jetty-run

Then you can see "Hello world!" at http://localhost:8080.
